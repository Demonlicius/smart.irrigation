This code belongs to the main node equipped with a LoRa chip, responsible for communicating with the Arduino LoRa receiver. Its function is to receive data from the sensor network formed by the ESP32 sensor nodes and forward it to the Arduino. This approach is more efficient and cost-effective, using the ESP-NOW protocol for internal communication between sensor nodes and the main node, while the main node uses LoRa to transmit data to the receiver connected to the Internet.
